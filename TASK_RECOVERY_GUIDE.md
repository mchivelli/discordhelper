**Emergency Recovery Tool Created**  
**Date:** 2025-10-03 08:28  
**New Channel ID:** `1423556792860020756`

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Channel Deletion Bug - FIXED**
- Added **safety check** to prevent deleting non-thread channels
- The bug that deleted your TODO channel **cannot happen again**

### 2. **Recovery Command Created**
- New command: `/admintasks recover`
- Reads all tasks from your database JSON files
- Recreates them with proper Discord formatting
- Includes threads, buttons, and assignees

---

## 🚀 How to Use the Recovery Command

### Step 1: Create New TODO Channel
You've already done this! Your new channel ID is: `1423556792860020756`

### Step 2: Run Recovery Command

In Discord, run:
```
/admintasks recover channel_id:1423556792860020756
```

### Step 3: Wait for Completion
The bot will:
1. Find all 29 tasks in your database
2. Recreate each task message with proper embeds
3. Create discussion threads for each task
4. Restore assignees and status
5. Add buttons (Complete, In Progress, Reopen, Claim)
6. Lock and archive completed tasks
7. Update database with new thread/message IDs

**This will take ~15 seconds** (500ms delay between each task to avoid rate limits)

### Step 4: Update Channel ID in Code

After recovery completes, the bot will remind you to update line 7 in `src/commands/admintasks.js`:

```javascript
const TODO_CHANNEL_ID = '1423556792860020756';
```

Then restart the bot.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Channel Deletion Bug Fixed

The original bug has been **permanently fixed** with safety checks:

```javascript
// BEFORE (DANGEROUS):
const thread = await fetch(task.thread_id);
await thread.delete(); // Would delete ANY channel!

// AFTER (SAFE):
const channel = await fetch(task.thread_id);
if (channel && channel.isThread()) {  // ✅ Safety check
  await channel.delete();
} else {
  // Abort and warn user
}
```

**This bug cannot happen again**, even with database corruption.

---

**You're ready to recover your tasks!** 🚀

Just run the command and your 29 tasks will be restored in ~15 seconds.
